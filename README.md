# SinEn - Sinhala Language Processing Toolkit

SinEn is an open-source natural language processing toolkit for Sinhala language, written in Python. The toolkit provides several tools for Sinhala language processing, including:

- SinEn Bad Words Detector: A machine learning model that can detect offensive or inappropriate words in Singlish text.
- SinEn Converter: A software tool that can convert Sinhala script to English transliteration.
- SinEn Stemmer: A program that provides stemming functionality for Singlish words, reducing them to their base or root form.
- SinEn Tokenizer: A program that can split Singlish sentences into individual words or tokens.

In addition to these tools, the project also includes supporting tools for collecting and processing Sinhala text, including a "Bag of Words Collector" and "Bag of Words Maker".
